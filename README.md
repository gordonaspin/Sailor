I wrote this IOS Navigation application to learn SwiftUI. I use the application on my iPhone as a navigation aid while sailing my MC Scow dingy. I have the phone mounted vertically so I can use it as a compass, knotmeter, and heel and pitch monitor.

The user interface presented is a map with four views superimposed that display information:
- Speed in knots, mph or m/s
- Heading, true or magentic north
- Heel angle
- Pitch angle

### Main Screen
The primary user interface displays the map, a compass icon, map scale and user location with heading. Overlaid on the map are the speed the device is moving, the magnetic or true heading, the degrees of heel (or tilt) and pitch of the device from vertical.

A tap gesture on each of the four metrics will bring up the settings screen for that metric
| Speed settings | Heading Settings |
| -------------- | ---------------- |

## Technical Design Details

The application design uses a few design patterns, principally Observer, State and Environment. SwiftUI development relies on these behavioral and creational patterns as a defacto standard.

### Observer
The application uses CoreLocation and CoreMotion to track the location of the device, its movement and orientation. This is where the two managers, or services use the Observer pattern.
#### LocationManager
The LocationManager uses CoreLocation to publish properties that describe the location and heading of the device
```swift
@Observable
class LocationManager: NSObject, CLLocationManagerDelegate {
    var speed: Double = 0.0
    var trueHeading: Double = 0
    var magneticHeading: Double = 0
    var heading: CLHeading?
    var userLocation: CLLocation?
    var isAuthorized = false
}
```
The properties of LocationManager are calculated within the LocationManager implementation and they are subscribed to by various Views within the application. This is achieved via injecting the LocationManager into the application environment by the SailorApp.
```swift
struct SailorApp: App {
    @State private var locationManager = LocationManager()
    ...
    var body: Some Scene {
        WindGroup {
            ...
        }
        .environment(locationManager)
    }
}
```
As the LocationManager is injected into the environment, View classes can subscribe to publications of the LocationManager by using the @Environment annotation:
```swift
struct SpeedView: View {
    @Environment(LocationManager.self) var locationManager
    ...
    var body: some View {
        Text("\(convertedSpeed, specifier: "%.1f")")
        ...
    }
}
private var convertedSpeed: Double {
    return settings.convertSpeed(speed: locationManager.speed)
}
```
#### MotionManager
The MotionManager uses CMMotionManager to publish properties that describe the movement or rotation of device
```swift
@Observable
class MotionManager {
    var rollAngle: Double = 0
    var yawAngle: Double = 0
    var pitchAngle: Double = 0
    ...
}
```
The properties of MotionManager are calculated within the LocationManager implementation and they are subscribed to by various Views within the application. This is achieved via injecting the MotionManager into the application environment by the SailorApp.
```swift
struct SailorApp: App {
    @State private var MotionManager = MotionManager()
    ...
    var body: Some Scene {
        WindGroup {
            ...
        }
        .environment(locationManager)
    }
}
```
As the MotionManager is injected into the environment, View classes can subscribe to publications of the MotionManager by using the @Environment annotation:
```swift
struct HeelAngleView: View {
    @Environment(MotionManager.self) var motionManager
    ...
    var body: some View {
        Text("\(convertedHeel, specifier: "%02d")ยบ")
        ...
    }
}
private var convertedHeel: Int {
    var tilt: Int = 0
    switch UIDevice.current.orientation {
        // calculate tilt based on orientation of device on 3 axes
        ...
    }
    return tilt
}
```
### State
The Views maintain a variety of state properties such as, color, trueNorth, Heel angle limits, etc. When these properties are modified by the user, the view reacts to the change and updates itself, e.g. with the HeelAngleView:
```swift
struct HeelAngleView: View {
    ...
    @StateObject private var settings = HeelAngleSettings.shared
    ...
    var body: some View {
        VStack() {
            Text("heel")
                .font(.title)
                .foregroundColor(settings.titleColor)
                ...
        }
    }
}
```
I use a Singleton pattern to gather view settings into a Settings class. This is a simple way to manage all related settings of a view. The default settings are in code, backed by the use of UserDefaults and Root.plist through @AppStorage. This allows changes to settings from the IOS Settings application and by Views within the application and these settings are stored automatically and restored when the application is restarted.
```swift
class HeelAngleSettings: Settings, ColorProtocol {
    let optimumHeelAngles = [10, 15, 20]
    
    static var shared = HeelAngleSettings()
    @AppStorage(wrappedValue: 1, "preference_heelColor") var colorIndex: Int
    @AppStorage(wrappedValue: 2, "preference_optimumHeelColor") var optimumHeelColorIndex: Int
    @AppStorage(wrappedValue: false, "preference_speakHeelAlarms") var speakHeelAlarms: Bool
    @AppStorage(wrappedValue: "The boat is too flat", "preference_underHeelAlarm") var underHeelAlarm: String
    @AppStorage(wrappedValue: "Too much heel", "preferences_overHeelAlarm") var overHeelAlarm: String
    @AppStorage(wrappedValue: 15, "preference_optimumHeelAngle") var optimumHeelAngle: Int
    ...
}
```
